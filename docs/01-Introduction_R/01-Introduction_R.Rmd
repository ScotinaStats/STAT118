**R** is a programming language designed originally for *statistical analysis*. 

- Created by **Ross Ihaka** and **Robert Gentleman** in 1993. 

- Formally released by the **R Core Group** in 1997.

# Why R?

R is *popular*, and **growing**!

# R's Strengths

Handling data with different **types** of variables
    
- **numerical** or **categorical**, but also *time*, *location* (longitude/latitude), *text*-based data, etc.
    
.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
flights_data = flights %>%
  select(year, month, day, sched_dep_time, dep_delay, carrier, dest) %>%
  na.omit()
head(sample_n(flights_data, 10))

# R's Strengths

Making nice and complex **data visualizations**

- and **customizable** - Make a visualization yours!

# R's Strengths

Most importantly, R is **open-source**. 

- There is no company that *owns* R, like there is for, say, Microsoft Excel. 

- Different R *packages* are written by **users**, like you and me!

**You can download R and RStudio anytime you want, for free!** 

- **R**: [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

- **RStudio**: [https://rstudio.com/](https://rstudio.com/)

(or just use [rstudio.simmons.edu](https://rstudio.simmons.edu/auth-sign-in), for now)

# Why R in STAT 118?

**STAT 118** is a course in [**modern**] *Introductory Statistics*. 

Two major goals are:

1. Understand data and be able to *communicate* results

2. **Do statistics**

--

Less of... $$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}$$

More of...

```{r}
sd( ~ dep_delay, data = flights_data)
```

# Some Basics

---

# What is RStudio?

**RStudio** is an IDE (*Integrated Developer Environment*)

- This basically means that RStudio is an *application* that makes it easier for you to interact with R.

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE}

- Released in 2011 by J.J. Allaire

---

# R Packages

A strength of **open-source** material is that you can freely share it (e.g., code) with other users!

- You can also *create* R packages, which are extra sets of code that add **new functionality** to R when installed.

# Some Example R Packages

[mosaic](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mosaic/versions/1.7.0)

- Functions used to simplify some of the R in Introductory Statistics courses

--

[openintro](https://www.openintro.org/)

- Contains **datasets** used in the *OpenIntro* textbook

--

[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

- A *suite of packages* for **Data Science** with a common underlying framework

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, dpi = 400, out.width = "50%"}
library(pupR)
pupR()

# R Packages in STAT 118

If you're using [rstudio.simmons.edu](https://rstudio.simmons.edu/auth-sign-in), you might have essential packages for the course already installed!

- Otherwise, you'll need to **install** them, but it's painless to do so!

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("r-install_packages.png")
```

# Time for some R!

**Let's go try it!**
