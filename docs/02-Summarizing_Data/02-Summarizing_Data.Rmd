# Examining Numerical Data

# Data Visualization: What is it?

> "The simple graph has brought more information to the data analystâ€™s mind 
> than any other device." -- John Tukey

**What information?**

--

- presence of **outliers**

- **distributions** (of individual variables)

- **relationships** (between groups of variables)

--

.center[
**Patterns** in data!

# Scatterplots

```{r, echo = FALSE}
airbnb_boston <- read_csv("~/Dropbox/Teaching/03-Simmons Courses/STAT118-Introductory Statistics [ONLINE]/Data/airbnb_boston.csv")
airbnb_boston = airbnb_boston %>%
  filter(room_type != "Hotel room")
```

**Relationship** between TWO *numerical* variables

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%"}
xyplot(price ~ bedrooms, data = airbnb_boston, 
       pch = 20, alpha = 0.4,
       xlab = "Number of bedrooms", ylab = "Price per night (in dollars)", 
       main = "Boston Airbnbs")
```
]

- *Direction* of relationship? *Strength*? *Form*?

# Scatterplots

**Relationship** between TWO *numerical* variables (and *one categorical variable*)

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE}

```

- *Direction* of relationship? *Strength*? *Form*?

---

# Histograms

**Histograms** provide a visualization of the *distribution* of a single *numerical* variable. 
- You need only specify an `x` variable in a histogram. 
- By default, the `y` variable is *count*. 

--

Suppose we are interested in the *distribution* of price per night for Boston Airbnbs. 

**Histograms** share the following information:
- What is the *range* of prices?
- What is the *typical* or *expected* price for an Airbnb?
- What are frequent and infrequent values?
- Is there any skewness?

---

# Histograms

In a **histogram**, observations are grouped into *bins* and plotted as bars. 

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "45%"}
histogram( ~ price, type = "count", data = airbnb_boston, 
           xlab = "Price per night (in dollars)")
```
]

--

**What do we notice?**

--

- *right skewed* 

- *prominent peak* at ~200 dollars

- prices *range* from *close to zero dollars* to *over 1,000 dollars*

---

# Histograms

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "45%"}
data(famuss)
histogram( ~ height, type = "count", data = famuss, 
           xlab = "Height (in inches)")
```
]

--

**What do we notice?**

--

- *symmetric* 

- *prominent peak* between 65 and 70 inches

- some *variability*

---

# Histograms and Shape

In addition to looking at whether a histogram is **skewed** or **symmetric**, we can also identify **modality**, or the presence of *prominent peaks*. 

--

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("histograms_modality.png")
```
]

--

You may describe a distribution's *modality* as:
- **unimodal**
- **bimodal**
- **multimodal**
- **uniform**

# Measures of Center and Spread

---

# Mean

The **mean**, or the *average*, is a common way to measure the **center** of a distribution. 

- The **sample mean** is often labeled as $\bar{x}$: $$\bar{x}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}}{n}$$

- Each of $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, ... are individual *cases* in a dataset, and $n$ is the **sample size**.. 

--

**In R**:

```{r}
library(mosaic) # Load this first!
mean( ~ price, data = airbnb_boston)
```

---

# Standard Deviation (and Variance)

The **mean** is useful in describing the *center* of a distribution. 

- But what about the **spread**?

--

**Standard Deviation**: A measure that represents the typical deviation of observations away from the mean. 
- Also the *square root* of the **variance**. 

--

The **sample standard deviation**, $s$, is calculated by: $$s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}$$

---

# Standard Deviation (in R)

This is much easier than calculating $s$ by hand!

```{r}
sd( ~ price, data = airbnb_boston)
```

--

**Interpretation**: The price per night of Boston Airbnbs typically *deviate* from the mean (&#36;163.46) by about &#36;140.51. 

--

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "45%"}
histogram( ~ price, type = "count", data = airbnb_boston, 
           xlab = "Price per night (in dollars)", 
           panel = function(x, ...) {
             panel.histogram(x, ...)
             panel.abline(v = 163.4621, col.line = "purple", lwd = 2, lty = 2)})
```
]


---

# Boxplots

A **boxplot** summarizes a dataset using *five statistics*:

- **minimum**
- **first quartile (Q1)** (25th *percentile*, i.e., 25% of observations fall below Q1)
- **median** (50th *percentile*)
- **third quartile (Q3)** (75th *percentile*)
- **maximum**

# Constructing Boxplots

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%"}
bwplot( ~ price, data = airbnb_boston, 
        xlab = "Price per night (in dollars)")
```
]

--

- **Median**: A measure of **center** that represents the *middle* observation an ordered dataset

--

- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: A measure of **spread** that represents the *middle* 50% of the data, given by the *box* in the *boxplot*. 
    - Also given by Q3 $-$ Q1
    
--

- **Whiskers**: Extend to (1) Q3 $+1.5\times$ IQR, *and* (2) Q1 $-1.5\times$ IQR
    - Any points outside the whiskers are marked as **outliers**

---

# Constructing Boxplots

# Robust Statistics

---

# Outliers

Suppose we replaced the **minimum** household income in this sample (&#36;12,000) with &#36;10 million. 
- How would sample statistics such as the *mean*, *median*, *standard deviation*, and *IQR* be affected?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
d <- read_csv("~/Dropbox/Teaching/03-Simmons Courses/STAT118-Introductory Statistics [ONLINE]/Data/house_income.csv")
house_income = d$house_income[!is.na(d$house_income) & d$house_income < 4000000]
options(scipen = 5)
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
histogram( ~ house_income, type = "count", 
           breaks = seq(1, 1050000, 50000),
           xlab = "Annual Household Income")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
bwplot( ~ house_income, xlab = "Annual Household Income")
```
]

---

# Outliers

```{r, echo = FALSE}
house_income[which.min(house_income)] <- 10000000
```

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
histogram( ~ house_income, type = "count", 
           xlab = "Annual Household Income")
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
bwplot( ~ house_income, xlab = "Annual Household Income")
```
]

---

# What happened?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
summary.data = data.frame(median = c(190, 200), IQR = c(200, 200), mean = c(245, 316), s = c(226, 854))
row.names(summary.data) = c("Original Data", "Replace min with $10 million")
knitr::kable(summary.data, format = "html", row.names = TRUE)
```

--

The *median* and *IQR* are called **robust statistics**. 
- Extreme observations have very little influence on their values. 

--

If a distribution is **skewed**, then the *median* and *IQR* are often more helpful in describing the *center* and *spread*, respectively.

- **observational study**

]

--

This display is called a **contingency table**. 

- *Two* categorical variables: `fracture` (Yes vs. No) and `treatment` (SSRI vs. No SSRI)
    - **Example**: Of the 137 patients *taking an SSRI*, 14 (10.2%) *experienced fractures*. 
    
---

# Barplots

A **barplot** is a common way to display one or more *categorical variables*. 

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%"}
fracture_total <- t(data.frame(ssri_data[1:2, 3]))
names(fracture_total) <- c("Yes", "No")
barplot(fracture_total, xlab = "Experienced fractures?", names.arg = c("Yes", "No"), 
        ylim = c(0, 5000), ylab = "Frequency")
```
]

---

# Row and Column Proportions

But does the *single variable* barplot help us determine relationships between *two* variables?
- No!

**Row** and **column proportions** give a *fractional breakdown* of one variable in another. 

--

**Row Proportions**

.center[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
ssri_data_prop = data.frame(taking_ssri = c(0.054, 0.026, 0.027), no_ssri = c(0.946, 0.974, 0.973), total = c(1.000, 1.000, 1.000))
names(ssri_data_prop) = c("Taking SSRI", "No SSRI", "Total")
row.names(ssri_data_prop) = c("Experiences Fractures", "No Fractures", "Total")
knitr::kable(ssri_data_prop, format = "html", row.names = TRUE)

]

--

- Of those *experiencing fractures*, 94.6% did *not* take an SSRI. 
    - Most patients did not take an SSRI...
